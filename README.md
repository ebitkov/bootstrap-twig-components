# Bootstrap UX Twig Components

The goal of this project is to implement all components of the [Bootstrap frontend framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) as [Symfony UX Twig Components](https://symfony.com/bundles/ux-twig-component/current/index.html), reducing the amount of code while including all the recommended attributes (e.g. `role` or `aria-`).

# Contribution

Contributions are welcome. For more details about the current progress please review the issues and milestones. 

Please keep in mind that this project tries to simplify the use of Bootstrap, not complicate it, while keeping the flexiblity of the framework. Therefore every feature described in the Bootstrap documentation must be supported and covered by an automated test.
